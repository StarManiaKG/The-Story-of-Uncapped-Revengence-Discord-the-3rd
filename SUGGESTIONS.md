## IDEAS

DMZ-Like Gamemode in SRB2
May Require TSoURDt3rd Hardcoding for Utmost Efficiency

Expose Snake, Window Title, and Discord Stuff to TSoURDt3rd lua

add customizable special stage themes
    add demo 4 and pleasure castle and all that too
	god dang it add customizable character select themes

## OTHER IDEAS

  - (Maybe?) Add Video Support (Definitely not Stolen from LJ Sonic)
  - Add an Extended Server Browser/Property Menu
  - Port over Any-Res since I've done it for Android and Ring-Racers already :p
  - (Maybe?) Add Kart's Server Menu
  - Add Fog Back
  - Add More Timed/Time of Year/Month Events
  - RedXVI
  - Port Over and Work on Some of Lactozilla's Branches
    - Definitely Levelstruct and Delfile, at the Very Least
  - Add Tetris
    - Of course i have no dang clue how to even do this but it's possible
    - On Top of That, Allow Mini-Games to Give Players Lives in Multi-Player (Maybe?) **
  - Add a Garry's Mod Mode (Eventually) **
    - Will be Called Star's Mod, Purely For Kicks
  - Work on 2.1 and Android Support, Once I Find the time
  - Saved character presets in the Player Setup menu (like profiles from ring racers)
  - Custom font support (which can be easily taken and revamped from ring racers)

## CURRENT GENERAL SRB2 IDEAS

  - Add "dowad" Function of Sorts (for lua)
  - Port My "Reset to Defaults" Function for the Player Select Menu in TSoURDt3rd to Vanilla
	- (StarManiaKG from the future: debating still)
  - Work on SRB2 Utopia Once TSoURDt3rd Has Been Ported to 2.2.11
	- (StarManiaKG from the future: lol)
  - Add a "Enter Password to Join" Feature **


## REFERENCE

** - Probably for TSoURDt3rd-only servers :p
** - Probably (*probably*) a stupid idea too


## So far, I've added/done:
