## What Even is This?
For starters, [Sonic Robo Blast 2](https://srb2.org/) is a 3D Sonic the Hedgehog fangame based on a modified version of [Doom Legacy](http://doomlegacy.sourceforge.net/), and this custom build of SRB2 is based on both of those.

The Story of Uncapped Revengence Discord the 3rd, or TSoURDt3rd for short, was originally a compilation of both the Uncapped-Revengence branch, by Eidolon, and Discord Rich Presence Support, orignally made by Kart Krew for SRB2 Kart and ported to Vanilla SRB2 by Fafabis.
However, as time went on, I added my own custom features to SRB2's code, and eventually ported some features over from other repositories, ultimately forming my own unique and custom build of SRB2.

With this build being continiously built, or in other words, a rolling release build, it usually gets built fairly regulary, and will eventually contain more and more features over time.

The build and its executable files can be found in the provided ZIP file, with folder containing the assets, libraries, and files for each different version of TSoURDt3rd, all containing folders for different operating systems as well.
- (...Except for Mac Users, at least for now. You'll have to compile this build yourself. Sorry :p)

***
  - **Autoloading Addons**
    - (Made by Me)
***
  - **Autoloading Addons** ***(cont.)***
    - Using Right Shift over an add-on or folder in the add-ons menu allows you to select add-ons or folders that will autoload when SRB2 first starts up.
    - This feature also allows you to bypass modifiedgame checks when the game first starts up, allowing you to play all the add-ons you want, in whatever savefiles or modes you want.
    - This feature also creates new savefiles for whenever autoloading is active, meaning that your normal savefiles are safe and secure.
	  - Your gamedata is still used and intact, however.
***
  - **Autoloading Addons** ***(cont.)***
    - To stop certain, or all, addons from autoloading on startup, look at the ```autoload.cfg``` file, located in your SRB2 directory, and remove the add-ons and folder names there.
    - Autoloading add-ons still does affect netgames and the ability to join them, though. If you've loaded game-changig add-ons, you still need to relaunch with the base WADs loaded in other to join other netgames.

  - **A Jukebox**
    - (Made by Me)
***

***
  - **A Jukebox** ***(cont.)***
    - _How To Add Custom Music to the Jukebox:_
      - First, you need to have the ```jukebox.pk3``` file and your custom music on hand. Make sure your music is in the proper format.
      - Then, you need to add your music to the ```jukebox.pk3``` file.
      - Lastly, open the ```MUSICDEF``` file within ```jukebox.pk3``` and add your custom music to that file. If you need to, use some of the pre-existing lumps in the ```MUSICDEF``` file as an example on how to add your music to the file.
        - Make Sure you Name the Files Correctly. Remember that The First Two Characters in the Name of a Music Lump, I.E O_ or D_, Are Exempted From the Lump Name in the ```MUSICDEF`` file, with the Other Characters Being Required in that Field.
      - Alternatively, you could just follow this SRB2 Wiki tutorial on how to create ```MUSICDEF``` files.

**WIP FEATURES (MOST LIKELY CAN BE FOUND ON OTHER BRANCHES)**
  - Discord's Game SDK (it compiles fine, but nothing's there yet :P)
  - Android Support (currently at the extremely bare minimum :P)
  - ...And Even Some Annoyances!

**FUTURE FEATURES (WITH ENOUGH TIME IN THE OVEN)**
  - Netplus (really on a limb here)
  - Dynamic Resolutions (annoying to port from SRB2 v2.2.6 to v2.2.11)
  - Software Models (its going to be annoying to port, just like the above)
  - MP4 Support (this is all lj sonic's fault, because he inspired me to do this, and i'm definitely not doing this of my own volition)
  - ...And A Boatload of Even More Annoyances!

## Compiling
- See [SRB2 Wiki/Source code compiling](http://wiki.srb2.org/wiki/Source_code_compiling)
- Also see [SRB2 Wiki/Source code compiling/Makefiles](http://wiki.srb2.org/wiki/Source_code_compiling/Makefiles), and [SRB2 Wiki/Source code compiling/CMake](http://wiki.srb2.org/wiki/Source_code_compiling/CMake), depending on the type of compiler you're using

**ALTERNATIVES**
- You can check out the releases page! These include console scripts and ```.exe``` files, both for Linux and Windows users, respectively. AppImage support will also come soon, but Wine also exists, so if you're into that type of thing, ```.exe``` files will work for you too I guess.
- You can also Cross-Compile Between Different Operating Systems too!
- You could ask a friend to do it for you too, since friends are the best after all.

## Disclaimers
- Sonic Team Junior is in no way affiliated with SEGA or Sonic Team. We do not claim ownership of any of SEGA's intellectual property used in SRB2.
- Despite the title of this file making this seem like the title of a movie, I regret to inform you that this is not, sadly, a movie, but instead, an autobiography, on how I am a constant and passionate nusiance on my society.
