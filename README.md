[Sonic Robo Blast 2](https://srb2.org/) is a 3D Sonic the Hedgehog fangame based on a modified version of [Doom Legacy](http://doomlegacy.sourceforge.net/), and [This Custom Build](https://github.com/StarManiaKG/The-Story-Of-Uncapped-Revengence-Discord-the-3rd) is based upon those.

## Features
**NEW FEATURES**
  - Eidolon's Uncapped Revengeance, Now Properly In SRB2, Is Included, And Was Featured In This Build Early Enough For Me To Call It A "New Feature"
  - Custom Discord Settings, Commands, and Options, with Custom Character Support
  - Custom Build Options, Featuring More Savedata, Server, and Extra Options
  - Palette Rendering
  - Autoloading Addons
  - A Jukebox	  
  - ...And More Annoyances!

**FEATURES THAT WORK WITH ENOUGH EFFORT**
  - Holepunching; Requires Vanilla-SRB2 Based Relay Server, Kart Krew's Won't Work
  - ...And A Few More Annoyances!

**WIP FEATURES (FOUND ON LATEST UNSTABLE BUILD)**
  - Netplus (really on a limb here)
  - Autoloading Folder Support (it's a funny story)
  - Discord's Game SDK (need to convert it to C)
  - Dynamic Resolutions (an annoyance to port from srb2 2.2.6 to 2.2.11)
  - Software Models (an annoyance to port just like Dynamic Resolutions)
  - Android Support (i can't tell you how hard this will be)
  - ...And Even More Annoyances!

## Compiling

See [SRB2 Wiki/Source code compiling](http://wiki.srb2.org/wiki/Source_code_compiling)

**ALTERNATIVES**
- You can check out the releases page! These include console scripts and .exe files, both for Linux and Windows users, respectively. AppImage will also come soon, but Wine also exists, so if you're into that type of thing, .exe files will work for you too I guess.
- You can also Cross-Compile Between Different Operating Systems too!
- You could also ask a friend to do it for you too, friends are the best after all.

- Despite the title of this file making this seem like the title of a movie, I regret to inform you that this is not, sadly, a movie, but instead, an autobiography, on how I am a constant and passionate nusiance on my soceity.
